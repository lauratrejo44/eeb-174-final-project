conceptual basis: I am interested in examaning the evolutionary history of birds in South America specifically in Guatemala.

Discussion of the data and computational challenges: I will use the occurence data downloaded as a csv file from PBDB. I will use this data to calculate speciation and extinction rates through time.
I need to extract the fossil range and locality data, format it for quantitave analysis and visualize the results.

Number of unique species for 3 clades:
Orinthae: 196
Felidae: 36
Chelonioldea: 2 

order of preference:Orinthae, Felidae, Chelonioldea

shell commands used to extract unique names: uniq, cut, tail, and sort.
cut -d ',' -f 6 pbdb_data.csv |tail -n+18|sort |uniq|wc -l 
cut -d ',' -f 6 jaguars.csv |tail -n+18|sort |uniq|wc -l 
cut -d ',' -f 6 seaturtle.csv |tail -n+18|sort |uniq|wc -l
