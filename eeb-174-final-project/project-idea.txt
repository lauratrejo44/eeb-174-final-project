conceptual basis: I am interested in examaning the evolutionary history of a clade. 

Discussion of the data and computational challenges: I will use the occurence data downloaded as a csv file from PBDB. I will use this data to reconstruct the fossil ranges. I need to extract the fossil range and locality data, format it for quantitave analysis and visualize the results.

Number of unique species for 3 groups:18,847;117,706;1,086,956

order of preference:Veniella, Portofiel,Dinosauria

shell commands used to extract unique names: uniq, cut, tail, and sort.
