Several authors (e.g. Wichmann, 1916; Kantor, 1922; Vignati, 1925; Kraglievich, 1946) recognized in this formation the existence of two levels, differentiated by color and separated by a discontinuity. They proposed that these levels are temporarily different. With regard to this, Cione and Tonni (1995, 1996, 2001, 2005) published revisions of the biostratigraphy and biochronology of Monte Hermoso Formation at Farola Monte Hermoso. These authors recognized two chronologically successive biozones, the Biozone of Trigodon gaudryi, biostratigraphic basis of the Montehermosan Stage/Age (late Miocene–early Pliocene), and the Biozone of Neocavia depressidens, biostratigraphic basis of the Lower Chapadmalalan Stage/Age (early Pliocene). However, other authors (e.g. Frenguelli, 1928; Bonaparte, 1960; Deschamps et al., 2012; Olivares et al., 2012; Tomassini, 2012) emphasized that the stratigraphic and paleontological differences are minimal, so it would not be possible to define with certainty two levels with different ages.","""channel""","",""

The lamniform sharks Isurus hastalis and Carcharocles megalodon that are present occur elsewhere in upper Miocene beds (Ehret et al., 2012). Similarly, the pontoporiid dolphin Brachydelphis jahuayensis (MUSM 2425) is else- where restricted to the El Jahuay level (9.95 Ma; Muizon and Bellon, 1986; Lambert and Muizon, 2013). In addition, an inde- terminate penguin species (MUSM 2424; Spheniscus sp. 3; see Stucchi, 2007) also occurs in El Jahuay, Aguada de Lomas, and Montemar localities (9.95 Ma–7.30 Ma; Ehret et al., 2012). Fur- thermore, the phocid seal material (MUSM 2251) represents an undescribed Acrophoca-like species. Moreover, the presence of the mollusk Chione suggests that the deposit is at least 10 Ma, because it is identified elsewhere in 14–10 Ma deposits (DeVries, pers. comm., October 2010). Collectively, these fossil occurrences point to at least late Miocene age, but we could not exclude an older age. According to this, a correlation with the El Jahuay level (9.95 Ma, Tortonian) in the Sacaco area (Peru) is possible. Further investigation regarding the geology and geo- chronology of the locality is ongoing.","marine indet.","",""
